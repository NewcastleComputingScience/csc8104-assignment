== Flight User Stories

A consumer of your flight booking api should:

* Be able to create a Customer record with a name, an email and a phonenumber. 
* Be able to retrieve a collection of all customers (and associated information) with a single request.
* Be able to create a Flight record with a flight number, a point of departure and a destination.
* Be able to retrieve a collection of all flights (and associated information) with a single request.
* Be able to create a Booking record, with a Customer id and a Flight id.
* Be able to retrieve a collection of all bookings made by a particular Customer, with a single request.
* Be able to delete a Booking record.
* *Not* be able to delete Customer or Flight records (these are unsupported operations).
* *Not* be able to make create a Customer/Flight/Booking record with incomplete or invalid information.

=== Validation

The validation requirements for your application's data are up to you, though for simplicities sake we suggest something like the following:

* Customer *name*: a non-empty alphabetical string less than 50 characters in length.
* Customer *email*: a non-empty string which is a valid email address.
* Customer *phonenumber* : a non-empty string which starts with a 0, contains only digits and is 11 characters in length.
* Flight *number*: a non-empty alpha-numerical string which is 5 characters in length.
* Flight *point of departure*: a non-empty alphabetical string, which is upper case and 3 characters in length.
* Flight *destination*: a non-empty alphabetical string, which is upper case, 3 characters in length and *different* from its point of departure.
* Customer/Flight/Booking *id*: a Long, which should be settable or changable by an api consumer.
