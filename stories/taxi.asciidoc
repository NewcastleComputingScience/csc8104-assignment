== Taxi User Stories

A consumer of your taxi booking api should:

* Be able to create a Customer record with a name, an email and a phonenumber 
* Be able to retrieve a collection of all customers (and associated information) with a single request.
* Be able to create a Taxi record with a registration, and a number of seats.
* Be able to retrieve a collection of all taxis (and associated information) with a single request.
* Be able to create a Booking record, with a Customer id and a Taxi id.
* Be able to retrieve a collection of all bookings made by a particular Customer, with a single request.
* Be able to delete a Booking record.
* *Not* be able to delete Customer or Taxi records (these are unsupported operations).
* *Not* be able to make create a Customer/Taxi/Booking record with incomplete or invalid information.

=== Validation

The validation requirements for your application's data are up to you, though for simplicities sake we suggest something like the following:

* Customer *name*: a non-empty alphabetical string less than 50 characters in length.
* Customer *email*: a non-empty string which is a valid email address.
* Customer *phonenumber* : a non-empty string which starts with a 0, contains only digits and is 11 characters in length.
* Taxi *registration*: a non-empty alpha-numerical string which is 7 characters in length.
* Taxi *number of seats*: a non-zero integer, in the range of 2-20.
* Customer/Taxi/Booking *id*: a Long, which should **not** be settable or changable by an api consumer.
