= CSC8104 Introduction

The module learning outcomes, and intended skill outcomes can be found on the link:http://www.ncl.ac.uk/undergraduate/modules/csc8104/[Enterprise Middleware page].

To complete this coursework you *MUST* first complete the tutorial document and then move onto the coursework document.

== Tutorial

Follow https://github.com/NewcastleComputingScience/enterprise-middleware-coursework/blob/master/tutorial.asciidoc[this document]

You may also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAj5AlNr0LE[watch this video] to see the steps in action.

Many steps of the tutorial and video concern the environment setup necessary to undertake the coursework on your own machines. This year much of this setup has been performed for you on university machines.
If you are solely using a university machine to perform the coursework, you should complete only the subsections of the https://github.com/NewcastleComputingScience/enterprise-middleware-coursework/blob/master/tutorial.asciidoc[tutorial] which are highlighted as necessary for *all students*.

IMPORTANT: Immediately after you create your GitHub account and Red Hat Developers account, email Adam Booth at (a.booth2@ncl.ac.uk) with your name, email address, GitHub username and Red Hat Login ID.
Adam will then create your private repository. You will then receive an email informing you of the details once everything is ready.


== Coursework

IMPORTANT: You must use the allocation list below to determine which service type you will implement.

He has an experience with a multitude of technologies and programming languages and has worked as a Professional Software Engineer before returning to higher level academics.

== Finally
Demonstrators will be available in your cluster rooms during all practical sessions. You should go and see them if you are having any difficulties. This includes understanding what you have to do.

Discussion Boards will also be available for CSC8104 in Canvas (http://canvas.ncl.ac.uk) and Teams. You may post any questions about the tutorial or coursework assignment here, and the discussion boards will be monitored by Course Demonstrators. Also, any question which demonstrators encounter frequently (either on Blackboard or in practical) will be placed in a *Frequently Asked Questions* document which we maintain https://github.com/NewcastleComputingScience/enterprise-middleware-coursework/blob/master/frequentlyaskedquestions.asciidoc[here]. Before asking a question we encourage you to check both these places to see if it has already been answered.

In particular, notice the https://github.com/NewcastleComputingScience/enterprise-middleware-coursework/blob/master/frequentlyaskedquestions.asciidoc#i-cant-work-out-how-to-do-[answer] which refers to documentation. The use of 3rd party documentation is absolutely *essential* throughout this coursework, and demonstrators may often answer questions by pointing you to the relevant websites.

TIP: If you see a question on the discussion boards you know how to answer, we strongly encourage you to assist your colleagues!
